# Session Logs

This folder holds **one markdown file per work session**.

## Why this exists
- So “future me” can restart in under 60 seconds.
- To capture decisions, friction, and the next executable steps.

## Naming convention
Use:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_<short-topic>.md`

Examples:
- `2026-02-05_mcp-102.md`
- `2026-02-06_notebook-runthrough.md`

## Rule of thumb
If logging feels like homework, you’re writing too much.

Minimum fields that must exist:
- Goal
- Decisions
- Friction
- Next — Immediate

## Quick restart checklist (open this log and answer fast)
1) What file do I open first?
2) What command(s) do I run?
3) What secrets/config do I need?
4) What is the next smallest step?
