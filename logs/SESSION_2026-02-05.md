# Session

**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Repo:** Model-Context-Protocol-102  
**Branch:** main  
**Timebox:** 45 min  

## Goal
Clarify how skills are used in this repo by updating docs so a fresh clone can be understood and run in <10 minutes.

## Current State
- What I’m starting with: Repo runs, notebook works, docs explain MCP but not how skills/logging fit in
- What I expect to change: Add a short skills explanation + clarify how session logs are used

## Decisions (with why)
- Accepted Claude’s proposed README structure because it reduced cognitive load for new users
- Kept scope limited to documentation to validate the session-logger workflow without expanding surface area

## Actions Taken
- Asked Claude Code to review repo for fresh-clone clarity
- Accepted documentation edits to README.md
- Accepted cleanup and clarification of RUNBOOK.md

## Friction / Confusion
- Minor uncertainty about whether to continue improving docs vs stopping to log the session

## Notes (only if needed)
- 

## Next — Immediate (15–30 min)
1) Review README.md once more as if cloning fresh
2) Commit accepted documentation changes
3) Push to GitHub


## Next — Short Term (later today / tomorrow)
- 

## Restart Test
If I came back tomorrow, I would:
1) Pull latest changes
2) Follow RUNBOOK.md quick start
3) Confirm notebook opens and runs
