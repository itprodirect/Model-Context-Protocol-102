# Session

**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Repo:** Model-Context-Protocol-102  
**Branch:** main  
**Timebox:** 45 min

## Goal

Run the notebook end-to-end once and capture exactly what config/inputs are required so I can restart instantly.

## Current State

- Repo has `Model-Context-Protocol-102.ipynb`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and empty `logs/`.
- A venv exists locally (`venv/`).

## Decisions (with why)

- Entry point is `Model-Context-Protocol-102.ipynb` because it’s the only notebook and matches README.
- I will not refactor the notebook today; only validate run + capture prerequisites.
- standardize env as `.venv/`; always run Jupyter via `python -m jupyter lab` to avoid PATH issues.

## Friction (what slowed me down)

- Friction: venv python/jupyter were created from removed Anaconda install; recreate venv using system Python (py -m venv) and reinstall deps.
-

## Notes (only if needed)

✅ Verified

Kernel points to: C:\Users\user\Desktop\Model-Context-Protocol-102\.venv\Scripts\python.exe

Notebook runs end-to-end successfully

🔁 Restart Steps (tomorrow-proof)

cd C:\Users\user\Desktop\Model-Context-Protocol-102

py -m venv .venv (only if .venv missing)

.\.venv\Scripts\activate

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

python -m jupyter lab

In JupyterLab: Kernel → select .venv

## Next — Immediate (15–30 min)

1. Open `Model-Context-Protocol-102.ipynb` and run cells until the first failure.
2. Record the exact missing dependency/config in this log.
3. Update README (only if the missing step is not already written there).

## Next — Short Term (later today / tomorrow)

- Ask Claude Code to propose a tiny “config section” improvement for README (no refactor).

## Restart Test

If I came back tomorrow, I would:

1. `source venv/Scripts/activate`
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the notebook and run top-to-bottom
